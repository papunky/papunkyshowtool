## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not configured"
**Solutions:**
1. Check environment variable name: Must be exactly `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Verify you triggered a redeploy after adding the environment variable
3. Check that your API key is valid at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### Issue: API quota exceeded
**Solutions:**
1. Gemini has generous free quotas, but check your usage at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. The tool includes 1-second delays between requests to respect rate limits
3. Try uploading smaller CSV files (10-20 tracks at a time)

### Issue: Research not working
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Verify your CSV format has "artist" and "title" columns
3. Ensure stable internet connection during research

### Issue: Invalid JSON responses
**Solutions:**
1. This is rare with Gemini, but the tool includes fallback handling
2. Failed tracks will be added with basic info and marked for manual research
3. You can retry by uploading the CSV again

## CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV file should have columns for artist and track title:

**Supported column names:**
- `artist`, `Artist`, `Track Artist` - for artist names
- `title`, `Title`, `Track Name`, `name` - for song titles

**Example CSV:**
```csv
artist,title,album,year
The Beatles,Hey Jude,The Beatles 1967-1970,1968
Miles Davis,So What,Kind of Blue,1959
Fela Kuti,Zombie,Zombie,1976
```
